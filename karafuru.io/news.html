All Kara-pon machines have a giant screen above them that announces the rarity of the item you get and a ranking of all the Kara-pon hunters based on the items they have collected.

A method that has often been a point of contention between Torao and Egao. Uzachi, Mosu’s frenemy, never showed interest in any of this. But as the tournament goes on, Mosu spends all his time planning and searching for these Kara-pons. Although she may deny it, Uzachi secretly likes Mosu and wants to spend more time with him.

He spends all his time at The Playground hustling for Kara-pons. He knows everything about Kara-pon and knows everyone in the game. This little ball of excitement is always accompanied by his friend Futo. The polar opposite of Kuyaku in every way, Futo rarely makes a sound and stands there casually with his snacks while his friend chatters on.
